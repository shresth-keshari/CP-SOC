### CheckPoint - 1:
- Having completed C++ STL, I am curerntly solving binary search concept questions and looking forward to more CP concepts and contests.
- There's no code as such that I could have uploaded on this github repo, as all we do in this course is taking lectures and solving questions on platforms like LeetCode or Geeks for Geeks.
